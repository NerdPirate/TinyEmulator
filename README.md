TinyEmulator - An Emulator for TinyCPU
==================================================================

The purpose of this project is to build an emulator for TinyCPU from scratch.

TinyCPU is a super simple ISA. It has a 16-bit word size, and is big endian.
The ISA is not meant to be particularly efficient, rather the design is hopefully
easy to emulate.
